# Workflow Automation with the ChatGPT API

A learning path on how to automate complex workflows using chain calls to a large language model (LLM).

Topics:
- Classifying user queries to a chat agentâ€™s response.
- Evaluating user queries for safety.
- Processing tasks for chain-of-thought, multi-step reasoning.
- Chains of prompts that interact with the completions of prior prompts.
- Systems where Python code interacts with both completions and new prompts.

Outcomes:
- Evaluate your LLM inputs and outputs for safety, accuracy, and relevance.
- Split complex tasks into a pipeline of subtasks using multistage prompts.
- Build multi-step systems using large language models.
